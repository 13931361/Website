Version 6 of BlueWallet has been introduced a couple of months ago and it brings all the power of Multisig to a mobile app. 

The goal is simple, as a user learns about bitcoin and goes on its own self-sovereign journey there will be a moment where he realises security is a real concern. Bringing users from learning how to backup a seed, to discover cold storage and thinking about Multisig can now be easily done within BlueWallet.
