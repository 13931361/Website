To refill a wallet, 3 confirmations are needed for the transaction to clear. The 3 confirmations time will depend on the transaction fee added, bigger is the transaction fee, faster the Bitcoin Network will process the transaction.

The wallet also provides a way to manually refresh. Go inside the wallet you want to update and do a "pull-to-refresh", drag the view down to activate the refresh mechanism.
